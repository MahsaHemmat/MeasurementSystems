# Chronometer
Here a **chronometer** using two pushbuttons have been made.
- One of them is used to **start/stop** the chronometer and the other one is used to **reset** the chronometer value.
- Also a LED is programmed to blink every second regardless of chronometer being used or not.
- The program will report the elapsed time in microseconds after the stop button is pushed in the serial monitor.\
The circuit implemented for this code is shown.
