# LED light control
Light control is part of home automation features where the ambient light is adjusted automatically. To achieve this, the amount of light must be measured and processed to calculate the control signal. There are various photoelectronic options for light sensing. ere, we use a photoresistor.
1. The required circuitry has been designed and implemented as shown in the figure.\
2. The microcontroller has been programmed to measure and report the level of illumination using the look up table in order to convert resistance to illumination.
3. The program is completed by adjusting the LED light based on the measure illumination.\
