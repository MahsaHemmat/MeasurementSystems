# Position and Velocity determination using an Encoder disk
In this mini project:\
- First an encoder disk has been made.
- required circuitry has been implemented to run opto-switch module.
- Microcontrooler has been programmed to sense the change in opto-switch module and report the position and speed of the encoder disk .
- Also LED will toggle each time a state change is received from the module
